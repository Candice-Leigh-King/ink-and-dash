        Hey!
      </h3>
      <p class="editable">
        Super happy you're here. I'm Catherine but I have to make it a bit tricky for you. My nickname is Cassie and I often go by Cas.
      </p> <p class="editable">
        I'm a full-time freelance copywriter who also loves writing free verse poems. In 2017, I graduated with a degree in journalism and soon landed a job that allowed me to write for a diverse portfolio of brands, such as Ford and Caterpillar. I've also worked for The Hershey Company as their online retail content writer and blogger for the Hersheyland website. Aside from writing, you can ask me anything about sustainability, animals or travel!

        My story
      </h3>
      <p class="editable">
        After graduating from Indiana University of PA with a degree in journalism and public relations, I knew I wanted to travel. I bought a one-way ticket to Australia, lived in Sydney for a year and later traveled to New Zealand for a month. That year-long adventure was my aha moment of realizing I wanted to see the world while still pursuing my passion for writing. And here we are! Now, I'm able to partner with incredible brands like you, whether you need SEO copywriting services, blog article writing or content proofreading.

          After reading the first article Catherine wrote for us — all I can say is Wow! The content was exactly what I had envisioned when we initially discussed the scope of the project. I absolutely LOVE IT! This has to be one of the best prepared & written posts we have on the blog. Thank you for your hard work on this!<br />
