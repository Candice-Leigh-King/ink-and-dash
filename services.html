        What I Do as a Freelance Copywriter
      </h4>
      <p class="editable">
        <br />Copywriting is a term that encompasses many forms of written copy. As a digital copywriter, my skills range from blog posts and press releases to copy editing and social media content.
      </p>
      <p class="editable">
        <br />With my extensive background as an SEO copywriter, I'm able to write copy that's tailored to your brand and target audience. Using the right tone and style, website copywriting can help you connect with your audience, technical longforms can portray you as an expert in your field and the perfect blog post can create a place for communal discussion - all while helping to increase organic website traffic.

        <br />What is Website Copywriting?
      </h3>
      <p class="editable">
        <br />Web copywriting is an umbrella term that can include all the services I provide and more. But for this context, it means digital content for your landing pages, product descriptions and other short-form texts. Need help with your "About Us" page, writing concise product descriptions or having an engaging landing page? I got you!

            <br />What is Article and Blog Writing?
          </h3>
          <p class="editable">
            <br />Writing effective blog posts is one of the best ways to connect with your audience. While they are less technical and more informal compared to a technical longform piece, engaging blog posts can be educational, entertaining or inspirational. Anything to do with your brand and industry can be turned into a blog post that encourages conversations between you and your customers. Blogs typically range from 500 to 1,000 words.

          <br />What is LongForm Copy?
        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
          <br />Longform copy averages about 2,300 words per article and takes a more technical and informative approach compared to blog article services. Technical longforms show your brand as an authoritative figure in the industry. This type of content can include step-by-step guides, "How Tos" and technical vocabulary to relate more to the experienced customers in your field.

          <br />How to Write an Effective Press Release
        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
          <br />Press releases can be for internal or external use. They're an effective way to relay pertinent information to employees or to generate publicity through the press. Do you need to make an official announcement, promote a new product or gain attention through a news story?<br /><br />Press releases are as short and sweet as they come but follow a specific format! Packed with heaps of crucial information, press releases are also often time sensitive materials.

          <br />What Does Revising, Proofreading and Editing Copy Mean?
        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
          <br />Practice makes perfect, but we don't all have time to perfect our sales copy or a blog article over an extended period. Having a second pair of eyes proofread and edit your work is the best way to catch minimal, as well as, more critical errors. Editing and proofreading can help you reach deadlines on time while delivering exceptionally concise and accurate copy.

      <p class="editable">
        <br />Anyone can manage personal social media writing, but when you're a business, it takes more than a few cute emojis to grab people's attention. Social media platforms like Instagram are one of the most valuable ways to reach your target audience. Posting beautiful photos and reels is great, but you also must provide value. This can be done through educational, inspirational or entertaining captions that include keywords and have a call to action.

        <br />Having detailed templates and checklists for your ongoing projects keep everyone organized. Both are strategic assets that can clarify expectations and save time no matter what project you have on hand. Templates and checklists can also be created as a base and later adapted to your different needs.

        <br />Why Would you Need Creative Writing Online?
      </h3>
      <p class="editable">
        <br />Telling a story is a direct path to human connection. People love listening to stories, especially when it's about a brand they already love. Creative writing allows your brand to truly connect on a personal level. Forget the logistics and professional euphemisms. Creative writing is more real, and in a time where it can be challenging to know the truth, showing up and being transparent can gain you heaps of trust.
