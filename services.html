      <h4 class="subtle-heading"> What I Do as a Freelance Copywriter </h4>
      <p>Copywriting is a term that encompasses many forms of written copy. As a digital copywriter, my skills range from blog post writing and press release writing to copy editing and social media copywriting. </p>
      <p>With my extensive background as an SEO copywriter, I'm able to write copy that's tailored to your brand and target audience. Using the right tone and style, website copywriting can help you connect with your audience, technical long forms allow you to be seen as an expert in your field and the perfect blog post can create a place for communal discussion--all while helping to increase organic website traffic.</p>

        <h3>  What Does Revising, Proofreading and Editing Copy Mean?</h3>
        <p>Practice makes perfect but we don't all have time to perfect our sales copy or a blog article over an extended period. Having a second pair of eyes proofread and edit your work is the best way to catch minimal, as well as, more critical errors.

      <h3> Social Media Services </h3>
      <p>Anyone can manage personal social media writing but when you're a business, it takes more than a few cute emojis to grab people's attention. Social media platforms like Instagram are one of the most valuable ways to reach your target audience. Posting beautiful photos and reels is great but you must also provide value. This can be done through educational, inspirational or entertaining captions that include keywords and have a "call to action".</p>
